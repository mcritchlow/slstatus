slstatus - suckless status
==========================
slstatus is a suckless status monitor for window managers that use WM_NAME
(e.g. dwm) or stdin to fill the status bar.


Features
--------
- Battery percentage/power/state
- CPU usage
- CPU frequency
- CPU iowait
- Custom shell commands
- Date and time
- Disk status (free storage, percentage, total storage and used storage)
- Available entropy
- Username/GID/UID
- Hostname
- IP address (IPv4 and IPv6)
- Kernel version
- Keyboard indicators
- Load average
- Number of files in a directory (hint: Maildir)
- Memory status (free memory, percentage, total memory and used memory)
- Swap status (free swap, percentage, total swap and used swap)
- Temperature
- Uptime
- Volume percentage (OSS/ALSA)
- WiFi signal percentage and ESSID


Requirements
------------
In order to build slstatus you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (slstatus is installed into the
/usr/local namespace by default).

Edit config.def.h to add or remove features from status bar.

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install slstatus (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running slstatus
----------------
See the man page for details.


Configuration
-------------
slstatus can be customized by creating a custom config.h and (re)compiling the
source code. This keeps it fast, secure and simple.


Todo
----
Porting to OpenBSD is the current goal before thinking about a release.

The following functions are not portable at the moment:
- ipv{4,6}
- ram_{free,perc,total,used}
- wifi_{perc,essid}
- cpu_{freq,perc,iowait}
- entropy
- swap_{free,perc,total,used}
- battery_{power,state}
- temp
- vol_perc
